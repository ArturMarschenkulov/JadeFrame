This folder contains graphics related code.

In this folder the graphics API backends are located, e.g. `OpenGL`, `Vulkan`, `D3D11`, `D3D12`, etc.
At the time of writing, only `OpenGL` and `Vulkan` are in a usable state.


# Goals


# Notes


# Resources
Here will be contained various resources about comparing graphics APIs. For more specific resources look into the `README`s of the relevant graphics API.

- [sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol): Is header only (STB-style) library with `sokol_gfx.h`, where it abstracts over OpenGL, Metal and D3D11. It has also other interesting headers, like `sokol_app.h` for window and input management.

- [DiligentEngine](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine): low-level graphics library, abstracts over OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, D3D11 and D3D12

- [LLGL](https://github.com/LukasBanana/LLGL): low-level graphics library, abstracts over OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, D3D11 and D3D12
